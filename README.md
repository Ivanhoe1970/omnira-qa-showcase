# Omnira QA Showcase 🚀

This is a QA automation showcase project inspired by the real-world functionality of **Omnira ASSET PLANNER™**.

It simulates a capital planning task scheduler, including a React frontend, a mock Node API, and Cypress tests — all integrated with GitHub Actions CI.

---

## 🧩 Features

- React UI for adding and displaying scheduled tasks
- Node + Express mock API with validation logic
- Cypress tests for:
  - Task creation
  - Form validation
  - Multiple task display
- GitHub Actions CI integration (runs on every push!)

---

## 💡 Why I Built This

As part of my application to **Omnira Software**, I wanted to create a small-scale QA simulation that reflects:

- Interdependent logic and constraints (like real-world planning tools)
- Test automation coverage of core workflows
- CI pipeline confidence for fast feedback

## 🛠️ Stack

- React
- Node.js (Express)
- Cypress
- GitHub Actions
